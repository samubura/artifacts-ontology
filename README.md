# What is this?
An Ontology for Artifacts in the A&amp;A meta-model for environments in Multi-Agent Systems

# What's in it?
_// TODO_

# Structure of the Repository
The file [ontology.ttl](ontology.ttl) is the definition of the core ontology with just classes and properties.

The folder [examples](examples) has files including individuals to model some domain.

# Contributing
Usually, work only on examples. Do not work on the main branch directly, use either a custom branch or the `develop` one.

To create a new example, copy the core ontology and start adding individuals.

If you make changes to the core ontology by adding classes or properties copy the part of your turtle file in the core ontology excluding the Individuals section.

If you make changes to the core ontology, it would be ideal to adapt the changes in the other examples.

If you make changes to the core ontology please make a pull request detailing why you suggest the change so it can be approved after some sort of evaluation.

Always export turtle files for readibility and style consistency.
